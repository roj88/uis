    Arguments:
        bcr (float): probability of success for control, sometimes
        referred to as baseline conversion rate
        mde (float): minimum change in measurement between control
        group and test group if alternative hypothesis is true, sometimes
        referred to as minimum detectable effect
        power (float): probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the
        null hypothesis is false, typically 0.8
        sig_level (float): significance level often denoted as alpha,
        typically 0.05
